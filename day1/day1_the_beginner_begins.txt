Pre-HOW: I wish you guys out there, SUCCESS ! Smoke some butt :-D

How Beginner begins to learn GOLang :

So Laisa, so Gopher, so Gals and Guys from all over the world, all walks of live,
lets start by asking ourself:

"WHY" should we learn GOLang?
   What will you get out of learning GOLang as well as a natural language of caliber German, Russian, Persian?

   How about financial freedom ?

   How about turning your ideas into touchable objects ?

   How about your touchable objects saving someone's live ?

   How about that someones's live that saved by your touchable objects, has kids that
   fly to Mars and scratch your name one some rock on rememberance of saving their parent ?

   So there is lots of great reasons to learn GOLang :-)

"When"
   Learn in the morning when you're fresh mentally and physically.
   Jocko Willink, the bad-ass just around the corner, gets up at 04:30 and says, "Disipline equals freedom".
   So, RISE and SHINE :-D
   You understand what that means ? Really ? 05:00, 05:30 is also fine. Main thing 2hrs intensive learning, every day.
   If yes, then your pulling yourself out of bed and learning in the morning when you're fresh mentally and physically!   

"How" do we want to lear go ?
   What will our learning environment look like ?

   Cheepest/Easiest to More Expensive to Most Expensive.

   Since I wish to help the ones in developing countries break-out through
   the learning of knowledge, we'll just start with the
   Playground

   I have a Youtube channel : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfu8oCyYYlfkU1uosOr1BYQ

   If my vids are helpful, appreciate a thumbs-up/subscribe to my channel.
   That way, I'll keep you supplied with "brain-food" and I love the collaboration :-D

   I'll be breaking the learning plan into :
   1) basics, starting in the
        primitive_data_types : https://github.com/cisgoio/GOLang/blob/main/primitive_data_types/variables/variables__play.txt
